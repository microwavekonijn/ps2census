## About

The PS2 Census library is here to simplify the interaction with the Planetside 2 Census API for Javascript and
Typescript projects.

## Requirements

### Event Stream

- Node.js v12+ or any modern browser with WebSocket support;
- DBG Census API Service ID.

### Rest API

- ES6;
- DBG Census API Service ID(optional, but recommended).

## Installation

```
npm install ps2census
```

For better performance it is recommended to install `bufferutil` and `utf-8-validate`, though this is optional. The
`--save-optional` flag can be used to install them as optionalDependencies.

## Getting started

### Event Stream

```js
const { CensusClient } = require('ps2census');

const subscriptions = {
  worlds: ['10'],
  eventNames: ['MetagameEvent'],
};

const client = new CensusClient('ServiceID', 'ps2', {
  streamManager: {
    subscription: subscriptions,
  },
});

client.on('ps2Event', event => {
  // Handle the event, for more information see http://census.daybreakgames.com/#websocket-details
});
// or
client.on('facilityControl', event => {
}); // Note that the event always starts with a lower case letter

client.on('subscribed', subscription => {
}); // Notification of a subscription made by the event stream
client.on('duplicate', event => {
}); // When a duplicate event has been received
client.on('ready', () => {
}); // Client is ready
client.on('reconnecting', () => {
}); // Client is reconnecting
client.on('disconnected', () => {
}); // Client got disconnected
client.on('error', error => {
}); // Error
client.on('warn', error => {
}); // Error, when receiving a corrupt message

client.watch();

// To terminate the client
client.destroy();
```

### Rest API

```js
const { Rest } = require('ps2census');

const client = new Rest.Client('ps2ps4eu', { serviceId: 'example' });

// Get character with items
client
  .getQueryBuilder('character')
  .resolve('item')
  .exactMatchFirst(true)
  .get({ 'name.first_lower': '^microwave' })
  .then(characters => {
    // Process the data
  });
```

## Nanite Systems ESS

With the Census ESS being having some issues the [NS ESS](https://nanite-systems.net) has made its entrance. Basic
usage with Typescript:

```ts
new CensusClient('serviceid', 'ps2', {
  streamManager: {
    endpoint: 'wss://push.nanite-systems.net/streaming',
  },
});
// or
new CensusClient('serviceid', 'all' as any, {
  streamManager: {
    endpoint: 'wss://push.nanite-systems.net/streaming',
  },
});
```
